# Excel-Coffee_Sales_Dashboard

The Excel Coffee Sales Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and visualize coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022. It integrates customer, product, and order information to provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The dashboard leverages Excel functionalities such as XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, pivot tables, charts, slicers, and timelines to create an interactive and visually appealing interface. Key features include tracking sales by coffee type, roast type, country, and customer loyalty, with dynamic filtering and sorting capabilities to highlight trends and top performers.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create an interactive Excel dashboard that enables users to analyze coffee sales data effectively. By combining data from customers, products, and orders, the dashboard aims to uncover insights into sales trends, identify peak sales periods, evaluate customer preferences, and assess the impact of loyalty programs. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface with pivot tables, charts, slicers, and a timeline to facilitate data exploration and decision-making for business stakeholders.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: XLOOKUP

- From customers and products to orders sheet
- Customer Name: =XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$B$1:$B$1001,,0)
- Email: =IF(XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0)=0,"",XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0))
- Country: =XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$G$1:$G$1001,,0)

### Step 2: INDEX MATCH

- Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price: =INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!I$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0))
- Note: the $ before D in orders!$D2 for example means D2 is fixed when copied horizontally while orders!I$1 is fixed when copied vertically

### Step 3: Multiplication formula for Sales

- Sales: ==L2*E2

### Step 4: Multiple IF functions

- Create columns Coffee Type Name and Roast Type Name
- Coffee Type Name: =IF(I2="Rob","Robusta",IF(I2="Exc","Excelsa",IF(I2="Ara","Arabica",IF(I2="Lib","Liberica",""))))
- Roast Type Name: =IF(J2="M","Medium",IF(J2="L","Light",IF(J2="D","Dark","")))

### Step 5: Date Formatting

- Order Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

### Step 6: Number Formatting

- Size: 0.0 "kg"
- Unit Price, Sales: $ US

### Step 7: Check For Duplicates

- Data > Data Tools > Remove Duplicates

### Step 8: Convert Range to Table

- Improves managing and refreshing of pivot tables when new data is added

### Step 9: Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts + Formatting

- Create TotalSales pivot table
- Rows: Order Date
- Group by months and years in tabular form
- Columns: Coffee Type Name
- Values: Sum of Sales with 0 decimal places
- Insert line chart: Insert > Charts > Line chart
- Hide field buttons
- Change colors for font, fill, legend, and gridlines
- Add vertical axis (USD) and chart title (Total Sales Over Time)

### Step 10: Insert Timeline + Formatting

- Insert timeline: PivotChart Analyze > Insert Timeline
- New timeline style (Green Timeeline Style)

### Step 11: Insert Slicers + Formatting

- Insert slicer: PivotChart Analyze > Insert Slicer
- One for Roast Type Name and Size

### Step 12: Updating the Pivot Table Data Source + Formatting

- Add Loyalty Card from customers to orders sheet
- Loyalty Card: =XLOOKUP([@[Customer ID]],customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$I$1:$I$1001,,0)
- Add Loyalty Card slicer
- New slicer style (Green Slicer Style)
- Change Roast Type Name Layout to 3 columns and Size slicer to 2 columns
- Copy Total Sales worksheet named Country Bar Chart
- Modify TotalSales pivot table with only Country in Axis and Sum of Sales in Values
- Insert bar chart sorting by Sum of Sales
- Add data labels and put units in US dollars
- Copy Country Bar Chart worksheet named Top 5 Customers
- Modify TotalSales pivot table with Customer Name in Axis
- Filter to show top 5 customers by Sum of Sales
- Sort by Sum of Sales

### Step 13: Building the Dashboard

- Create Dashboard worksheet
- Change column witch and row height to 1 and 5 respectfully
- Add shape for dashboard title (hold ALT to snap to grid)
- Move visuals from Total Sales, Country Bar chart, and Top 5 Customers worksheet (CTRL X and CTRL V)
- Arrange visuals to make an elegant dashboard
- Connect the timeline and slicers to each visual using Report Connections
- Remove gridlines: View > uncheck gridlines
- In File > Options > Advanced uncheck: show formula bar, show sheet tabs, and show row and column headers

## Insights

Total coffee sales from the four types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta) including all roast types, sizes, and whether or not a customer has a loyalty card, several insights can be drawn:

1. Variability in Sales: All four coffee types exhibit significant fluctuations in sales over the observed period (2019â€“2022), with no consistent upward or downward trend for any single type.
2. Peak Sales: Arabica and Liberica show notable peaks, with both reaching around 800 USD, suggesting occasional high demand for these types.
3. Seasonal Patterns: There appear to be seasonal or periodic spikes, particularly noticeable in Q1 of 2020 and Q3 of 2021 for Arabica and Q1 of 2022 for Liberica, which might indicate specific market trends or events driving sales.
4. Decline in 2022: All types show a general decline in sales toward Q3 of 2022, with Excelsa and Liberica dropping to their lowest points, possibly reflecting a market shift or reduced demand.
5. Relative Performance: Excelsa and Robusta tend to have lower and more stable sales compared to Arabica and Liberica, which experience more pronounced highs and lows.

These insights suggest that sales are influenced by external factors (e.g., seasonality or market trends) and that demand for Arabica and Liberica may be more volatile than for Excelsa and Robusta.
